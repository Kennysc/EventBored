      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p class="container">
         We are a group of young adults who wanted to give the residents of Richmond a place where they can connect with others and help their community. Our goal for our users is to create a collaborative community of citizens who help promote, organize and include other like-minded people to come together and make our city a safe and open environment that fosters creativity and ingenuity.

      <h2>Meet The Team</h2>
      <h3>Nikko Echevarria: Lead Designer</h3>
<p class="container">I am a resident who has been living in the area for over ten years. I moved from San Francisco when I was five and have enjoyed everything Iâ€™ve achieved here since then. My time in Richmond has shown me all the great things this city has to offer, but social stigmas suppress those good qualities entirely. As the lead designer for this website, I wanted to design something that was easy to use, interactive and could connect you to other citizens who have the same views as I have.</p>
